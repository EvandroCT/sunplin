NAME
       sunplin - Simulation with UNcertainty for PhyLogenetic INvestigations

SYNOPSIS
       sunplin ( expd <f1> <f2> <n> <m> | dist <f3> ) [-l <f4>]

DESCRIPTION
       sunplin (1) randomly expand a tree (expd) OR (2) calculates its patris-
       tic distance matrix (dist).

       To expand a tree, a newick formatted tree (f1) and the  species  to  be
       inserted (f2 - plain text) must be provided. In addition, the number of
       trees to generate (n) and the expansion method (m - (1) over the nodes,
       (2) over the branch lengths) is required.

       To  calculate  the  patristic  distance matrix, a newick formatted tree
       (f3) must be provided. If a nexus formatted  file  (containing  several
       trees) is used all corresponding patristic distance matrices are calcu-
       lated.

       In both cases, the output file name can be specified (f4). If  omitted,
       default names are used.

EXAMPLES
       sunplin expd sample.tree species.txt 1000 1

       expand  the  sample.tree provided by inserting the species specified in
       species.txt. The process is repeated 1000 times,  using  the  over  the
       nodes  method,  and the resulting trees are stored in a nexus formatted
       file named sample-expd.nex

       sunplin expd sample.tree species.txt 100 2 -l expanded-trees

       expand the sample.tree provided by inserting the species  specified  in
       species.txt.  The  process  is  repeated  100 times, using the over the
       branch lengths method, and the resulting trees are  stored  in  a  file
       named expanded-trees.nex

       sunplin dist sample.tree

       calculate  the  patristic  distance matrix of the sample.tree provided.
       The resulting matrix is stored in a file named sample-dist.txt

       sunplin dist sample.nex -l dist-matrices

       sunplin dist sample.tree

       calculate  the  patristic  distance matrix of the sample.tree provided.
       The resulting matrix is stored in a file named sample-dist.txt

       sunplin dist sample.nex -l dist-matrices

       calculate the patristic distance matrices of all trees provided in sam-
       ple.nex.  The resulting matrices are stored in a file named dist-matri-
       ces.txt

USAGE: R version

Tree expansion example:

dyn.load("sunplin-r.so")
.Call("expd","sample.tree","species.txt",100,1)

> dyn.load("sunplin-r.so")
> x<-.Call("expd","sample.tree","species.txt",100,1)
> y<-file("sample-expd.nex")
> writeLines(x,y)
> close(y)

Distance matrix computation example:

dyn.load("sunplin-r.so")
.Call("dist","sample.tree")

start up R from the terminal and copy the commands below

Note: dyn.load("sunplin-r.so") must precede any .Call(...)
